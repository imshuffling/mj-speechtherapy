        <p>Mary Jane Speech Therapy is an independent Speech and Language Therapy Service set up in 2001 by Mary Jane Iles.</p>
        <p>Mary Jane works in accordance with professional guidelines from the Royal
        College of Speech and Language Therapists, The Health and Care Professionals
        Council and The Association of Speech and Language Therapists in Independent
        Practice. She also abides by the laws of The Data Protection Acts 1998 and 2003
        and the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) 2018.</p>

        <p>Mary Jane is a registered Data Controller with the Information Commissioners
        Office (ICO), registration reference; Z9801207. She controls and processes all
        personal information for this service.</p>

        <p>The lawful basis for processing personal information is a ‘legitimate interest’
        under Article 6 of GDPR. Mary Jane Iles cannot deliver a service to your child
        without processing personal information.</p>

        <p>Personal data relating to health is ‘special category data’ under GDPR. Article 9.2
        (h) states ‘processing is necessary for the purposes of medical diagnosis, the
        provision of health care or treatment’</p>

        <p>Once a record has been made, this becomes a health record and is therefore
        under legal obligation. This means that records on individual children must be
        kept until after the child’s 25 th birthday (or 26 th birthday if 17 at the conclusion of
        their treatment) and the right to deletion of records is lost. This does not affect
        the right to withdraw consent to treatment. Withdrawing consent to treatment is
        still subject to safeguarding legislation.</p>

        <p><strong>Information/data includes:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The initial Case History you gave when you arranged your child’s first appointment. This will include the child’s name, age, date of birth, home address, medical, health, family, social and education history.</li>
          <li>Your email address and telephone number.</li>
          <li>Observation, assessment and treatment notes.</li>
          <li>Any assessment forms carried out with your child.</li>
          <li>Any reports that I have written about your child.</li>
          <li>Any reports or information regarding your child that you have shared with me or other professionals have shared with me.</li>
          <li>Any emails sent or received regarding your child.</li>
          <li>Any photographs you have provided for me to make indiv idualised resources for your child.</li>
          <li>Any video or voice recordings (specific consent will always be asked from parents to allow recording of any kind).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Any information gathered is done so with your child’s best interests in mind so that Mary Jane Iles can provide an efficient and effective service.</p>
        <p>I have legal and professional obligations to keep accurate records relating to any treatment I provide.</p>
        <p>The information gathered will be relevant and not excessive; adequate to meet the specified purpose of providing a good quality service for your child.</p>

        <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
        <p>All information about you, your child and their speech and language therapy is stored securely in my systems to ensure that I have a complete record of my service to them. Any paper based confidential information is stored securely in accordance with Data Protection regulations.</p>
        <p>Videos or voice recordings may be taken of a child with parental consent. These will be deleted as soon as they have been used for the purpose they were made.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Transportation of records – when it is necessary to transport records, for example when visiting a child for a therapy session or meeting, records are transported by car and are not left unattended.</li>
          <li>Parents telephone numbers – the telephone in which your number is stored is password protected.</li>
          <li>Laptops used are password protected.</li>
          <li>Reports written are password protected. Passwords are not stored on the same device as the reports. Paper files and notes are securely locked away from unauthorised people.</li>
          <li>Information sent by email is limited to what is absolutely necessary. For example, where possible a child’s first name or initials only will be used.</li>
          <li>Mary Jane prefers to send reports by Royal Mail rather than email.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Some parents are happy to scan reports from other professionals and email them to Mary Jane. Please be aware that this is done at your own risk and consider the sensitivity of the information you are sending before deciding to do so.</strong></p>

        <p>If you would like to discuss any of this information with me in person I will be happy to do so.</p>
